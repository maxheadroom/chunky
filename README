Chunky is a tool for easy sharing larger files with clients and partners.

_The problem:_ You have a file to send to some outside your company. This files is too large for eMail. Explaining FTP to your client is too complicated, using public sharing sites like senduit.com is too insecure and unprofessional.

After uploading you can choose to create a unique download link for this particular file. You enter some details for the link like customer name, customer email, your email, an expire date and maximum download count. Then a unique link is created for you and you will get an email notification about this link and the expiration details. Optionally you can send an automatically generated message to the customer too. The customer can download the file from the link until the expire date or max. download count has been reached. The link is unique and not guessable
